# Wireless-Modular-Haptic-Controller
A small, flexible and modular wireless haptic controller for mobile manipulator control. This project attempts to take the rudimentary controller design implemented [here](https://github.com/sherrardTr4129/RealSense-BNO055-Pose-Estimation), and add a more complex feature set. Multiple controllers can be used on the same mesh network to create more intuitive human-robot interfaces. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to create a configuration of controllers to provide dexterous control of a mobile manipulator system. The video below shows a single controller being used for controlling the locobot base with adaptive scaling control.
