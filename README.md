# Wireless-Modular-Haptic-Controller
A small, flexible and modular wireless haptic controller for mobile manipulator control. This project attempts to take the rudimentary controller design implemented [here](https://github.com/sherrardTr4129/RealSense-BNO055-Pose-Estimation), and add a more complex feature set.
